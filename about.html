<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a designer living in New York City. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I don't know anything about it.</p>

<p><strong>My Mission</strong><p>
<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a super-star designer on my own because I like to be my own boss.</p>

<p><strong>My Experience</strong><p>
<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web Design Course Mentor</strong>, General Assemb.ly
<br><em>New York, September 2014 - present</em> </li>

<li><strong>Freelance designer</strong> 
	<br><em>New York, August 2013 - Present</e></li>


</ul>
<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
<p>Rhode Island School of Design, BFA 2013<p>

	<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<p>Volunteer at YMCA</p>

<br>
